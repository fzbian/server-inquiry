# ServerInquiry

ServerInquiry is an API that enables communication between external applications and a server, opening ports and generating tokens that allow commands to be sent and executed more conveniently. In addition, thanks to its functionality, this API can improve the efficiency of data transmission and automate processes, providing a simpler and more effective solution for interaction between applications and servers.

You can implement the request in your application code, here is an example code in go.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

var (
	ip      = "64.225.107.137"
	port    = "8000"
	token   = "20f8637e-5b66-44e5-a151-afcdd83d407e"
	command = "pwd"
)

func main() {
	resp, err := http.Get("http://" + ip + ":" + port + "/api/command?token=" + token + "&cmd=" + command)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error in the request: ", err)
	}
	defer func(Body io.ReadCloser) {
		err := Body.Close()
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}
	}(resp.Body)

	body, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error when reading the answer: ", err)
	}

	fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

Or
If you wish to make a direct request
